        <img src="images/RegistrationClicker.gif"
          alt="An animated GIF showing the precision clicker program clicking continue at the perfect time.">
        <p>At Rose-Hulman, registration is very important. It is done by clicking a button right when the clock hits a
          certain time. The first people who click will get through first and register for the classes they want. That
          is why I made a precision clicker in an unspecified language which is extremely optimized and efficient. From
          testing, it will click with over 50 times as much precision as the best humans. It's safe to say I got the
          classes I wanted for next quarter!</p>

        <h2><a href="#">Automatized Cryptocurrency Tracking</a></h2>
        <img src="images/part-of-solproject.PNG" alt="An image showing a portion of my code from this project">
        <p>Developed this script that uses the solscan.io API to scan transfers from popular exchanges and track what
          the reciever does with the recently transferred funds. It is optimized to find insiders who are buying coins
          early before they become popular. This script found RTR, DJT, and more tokens before they were at 2 million
          market cap. RTR went to 130 million and DJT went to over 400 million.</p>
        <p>I have made it open source!</p>
